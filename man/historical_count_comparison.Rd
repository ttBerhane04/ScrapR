\title{historical_count_comparison (with count Stability Evaluation)}
\usage{
historical_count_comparison(
  historical_count_tables = NULL,
  current_count_table = NULL,
  target_date = NULL,
  count_tolerance = 1,
  iteration_tolerance = 3,
  time_window = 3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{historical_count_tables}{A list of previous count tables by date.}

\item{current_count_table}{The current date-count table.}

\item{target_date}{The specific date to evaluate.}

\item{count_tolerance}{Threshold for allowable count deviation.}

\item{iteration_tolerance}{Threshold for allowable count deviation between iterations.}

\item{time_window}{Number of days for calculating the average count.}
}
\value{
A boolean value indicating if the count for the focus date is stable or within the tolerance range.
}
\description{
This function evaluates the stability of a specific date's count in a series of historical data.
It checks if the count on the target date significantly deviates from a rounded mean of recent counts
or remains stable in previous observations.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
focus_date <- as.Date("2023-12-24")
historical_count_comparison(historical_count_list, current_count_table, focus_date, 2, 7)
